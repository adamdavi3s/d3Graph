There's a lot of redundant code here to begin with.

index.html shows what I'm trying to get displayed in a Qlikview extension for now.

Script.js shows the code of my script, it all works EXCEPT when I try to use the actual d3 library- I've spent a bit of time and have no idea why.
Will continue to update. I'm new to Github so hopefully I haven't set anything up incorrectly.
